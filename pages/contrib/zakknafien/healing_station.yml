      The healing station will create a way to heal your salvage-equipped battleships in your system
      quickly and at no cost.


      There are two keys to the healing station; sanctuary, and the salvage module.
      Sanctuary saves a ship from total destruction in a red star and sends it back to home star before exploding.
      Salvage heals a percentage of the ship’s hull for every ship destroyed in the same sector.
      See module descriptions for more details.


      We are going to exploit a quirk of sanctuary to create an infinite loop of death and rebirth, which,
      when paired with salvage, will heal our ships. In order for this loop to start, we must plant a
      sacrificial ship into hostile territory, equipped with sanctuary. To do this we need to find a planet
      with a Cerberus presence. Any cerb will do but I would suggest a base or a colossus, due to the
      resiliency of said cerbs.


      We must lure the cerb away (e.g. a guardian or colossus), clear them out (cerbs ships supporting a base), or
      keep them occupied long enough to colonize the hostile planet.


      Once that is done, we remove all friendly ships from the sector so we don’t cause
      any further harm to one of the keys to our healing station. Cerb poised to attack and planet freshly
      colonized, we must move our shipyard so that the newly colonized planet is the closest colonized planet
      to the shipyard. Once the shipyard is the closest to the cerb planet, we simply send a ship with sanctuary
      to the planet and voila, healing station. Ships can still go to and from the planet.
      Shipments may be run as normal.


      Salvage-equipped battleships can be healed by moving them into the
      sector containing the healing station.
