      Two hubs that can connect to create a temporary Warp Lane in your system.
      Two Warp Lane hubs (they are created in pairs) can be connected for one day, for a fixed Hydrogen cost
      (0.9H/AU). Once connected, ships can travel between the two end points instantly and without consuming hydrogen.
