      The scanner will send a single Battleship to a detected Blue Star. Blue Stars constantly
      collapse from the outside towards the star, have a very short lifetime, and offer no security;
      all participating player's Battleships will fire on each other, as well as the Cerberus forces
      in the system. The player with the last Battleship alive wins the mission.
